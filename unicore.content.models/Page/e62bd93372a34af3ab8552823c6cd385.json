The surest sign is a missed period, but you may find it difficult to remember the date of your last period.\r\n\r\nDo you have any of these signs of pregnancy?\r\n\u2022\tYour breasts look and feel different \r\n\u2022\tYou notice some spots of blood in your underwear \r\n\u2022\tYou feel nauseous\r\n\u2022\tYou need to pass water more than usual \r\n\u2022\tYou miss a period\r\n\r\nIf you think you are pregnant, it is best if you see a health worker. The earlier you find out, the sooner you can start planning for your new baby. A nurse or midwife will also be able to give you advice and help while you are pregnant.\r\n\r\nThe nurse or midwife will weigh you, check your blood pressure and test your water. \r\n\r\nWorried about seeing a nurse or midwife? Ask a friend to go with you.\r\n",
